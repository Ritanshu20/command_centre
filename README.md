# Command Centre Backend (Django)
Description
This is a **Django REST API** backend for a Command Centre application.  
It processes alerts from:
- Video Monitoring â€“ camera alerts, e.g., Intrusion Detection.
- Sensor Platform â€“ temperature or other readings.

Your project will have a service that will allow you to **correlate** video and sensor alerts within **5 seconds** of each other.  
It will also apply **severity levels** for alerting, depending on the type of event and the sensor readings.
